 * counts, and morph animations (Transform/FadeTransform on a group)
 * legitimately change those counts during begin() — resampling leaves
 * to the aligned counts and padding the child list with fabricated
 * duplicates. The flat restore then throws "VGroup.setPoints: expected
 * <aligned total>, got <original total>".
 *
 * Restore per node instead, using the begin() child records: leaves
 * (nodes that own points) take the snapshot's points directly;
 * containers first drop every child their begin() did not record —
 * exactly the fabricated padding, wherever it was inserted — then pair
 * the recorded children with the snapshot's children by index (a
 * snapshot copy preserves child order) and recurse. A recorded child
 * already missing at restore time was itself padding an EARLIER
 * animation added, which that animation's reset (resets run in segment
 * order) has already pruned: skip it — playback re-begins the earlier
 * animation and rebuilds it if needed. If the snapshot's child count
 * disagrees with the record, the two describe different trees and
 * there is no sound restore: fail loudly instead of installing copies.
